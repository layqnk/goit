    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <h2>Ice Cube - This day was a good day</h2>
    <p>
        <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
        Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God<br>
        I don't know, but today seems kinda odd<br>
        No barking from the dog, no smog<br>
        And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog<br>
        I got my grub on, but didn't pig out<br>
        Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out<br>
        Hooked it up for later as I hit the door<br>
        Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-four?"<br>
        I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top<br>
        And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop<br>
        Had to stop at a red light<br>
        Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight<br>
        And everything is alright<br>
        I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night<br>
        Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all<br>
        "Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"<br>
        Get me on the court and I'm trouble<br>
        Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double<br>
        Freakin' niggas every way like MJ<br>
        I can't believe today was a good day<br>

        <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
        Drove to the pad and hit the showers<br>
        Didn't even get no static from the cowards<br>
        'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me<br>
        Saw the police and they rolled right past me<br>
        No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction<br>
        As I ran the intersection<br>
        Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' "Yo! MTV Raps"<br>
        What's the haps on the craps?<br>
        Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em<br>
        Roll 'em in a circle of niggas<br>
        And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11, 7, even back door Little Joe<br>
        I picked up the cash flow<br>
        Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' "Domino!"<br>
        Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.<br>
        Today was a good day<br>
        
        <b>[Verse 3]</b><br>
        Left my nigga's house paid<br>
        Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade<br>
        It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic<br>
        The Lakers beat the Supersonics<br>
        I felt on the big fat fanny<br>
        Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani<br>
        And my dick runs deep, so deep<br>
        So deep put her ass to sleep<br>
        Woke her up around one<br>
        She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun<br>
        Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'<br>
        Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion<br>
        I was glad everything had worked out<br>
        Dropped her ass off and then chirped out<br>
        Today was like one of those fly dreams<br>
        Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams<br>
        No helicopter lookin' for a murder<br>
        Two in the morning, got the Fatburger<br>
        Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp<br>
        And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp" (Yeah)<br>
        Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up<br>
        Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up<br>
        Today I didn't even have to use my AK<br>
        I gotta say, it was a good day<br>
